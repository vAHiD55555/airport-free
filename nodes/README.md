# Airport-Free
## Free nodes, automatically renews subscription every 3h

- 更新时间（UTC+8）：`<update_time>`
- [v2ray nodes all in one](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/xiaoji235/airport-free/v2ray.txt).（Not recommended）
- [v2ray nodes all in one](<PROXY>/https://github.com/xiaoji235/airport-free/blob/main/v2ray.txt) （ you can use this if can not access）
- Since CDN acceleration will cache and cause node updates to lag, you can go to [Github](https://github.com/xiaoji235/airport-free) fetch [clash files](https://github.com/xiaoji235/airport-free/tree/main/clash) or [v2ray files](https://github.com/xiaoji235/airport-free/tree/main/v2ray)

### Used jsdelivr CDN speedup：

<table style="width:90%">

<clash_list>
</tr>
</table>

## Issues 🐞
- Due to the possibility that some of the nodes included in multiple websites may be duplicated, deduplication has been done, but there may still be some duplicates!
- Some websites may not be accessible in the future due to the GFW or the site itself, which may result in the inability to renew the subscription!
